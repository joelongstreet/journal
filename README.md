#journal [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/joelongstreet/journal.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/joelongstreet/journal)

`journal` is a simple command line utility which helps me keep track of all the little things I learn each day.

If you want to journal, you can:

1. clone this repo
2. add it as an alias in your .bashrc `alias journal="~/projects/journal/cli.rb"`, 
3. add a path to a mogno db in your .bashrc `export JOURNAL_MONGO_URI=mongodb://username:password@ds12345.mongolab.com:12345/journal-database`

Then, just call `journal` and use the cli
